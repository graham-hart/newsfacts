# Newsfacts UI

## Known Bugs:
	Navbar will occasionally freeze

---
## Description:
This website allows users to search through a database of news sites and vote on them based off of Bias & Reliability. 

---
## Demo Version:
[newsfacts.netlify.app](http://newsfacts.netlify.app)
However, because the backend is not currently online, this will not work unless you also host the database on your computer. Even then, the vote data will not be public. This site is just a demo.
